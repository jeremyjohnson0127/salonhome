					<p class="mb30">
						<span><b>a.	Authorization</b></span>
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					Professionals authorize us to hold, receive, and disburse funds on your behalf.

					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
						<span><b>b. Third Party Payment Service Provider</b></span>

					</p>
					<p class="mb30">

					The Networks require that you and SalonHome comply with all applicable bylaws, rules, and regulations ("Network Rules"). The Networks amend their rules and regulations from time to time. SalonHome may be required to change these Terms of Service in connection with amendments to the Network Rules. Significant portions of the Network Rules are available to the public at www.visa.com, www.mastercard.com, and www.americanexpress.com.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					Network Rules currently prohibit you from dispensing cash on any Card transaction. The Rules also restrict your ability to assess a surcharge or split a single transaction in to multiple transactions except in certain limited situations.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					Your use of Network logos is governed by the Rules; you agree to familiarize yourself with and to comply with these requirements.

						<span><b>7.1 ACCESS TO ACCOUNT FUNDS</b></span>
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
						<span><b>a.	Bank Account</b></span>
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					Subject to the payout schedule identified below, we will deposit amounts received by us for transactions you submit through the Services (less any applicable fees) to your verified bank account.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					In the event the bank account you link to your Account is incorrect and SalonHome is not able to debit or credit the bank account, the bank account will be de-linked from your Account.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
						<span><b>b. Instant Payout</b></span>
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					SalonHome also offers the option for instant payout. If you would like to receive your deposits via instant payout, you will need to elect for instant payout in your Account and link a valid U.S. debit card that is connected to a checking account to your Account. Note that pre-paid and reloadable debit cards will not be accepted. If you have elected instant payout, we will deposit amounts received by us for transactions you submit through the Services (less any applicable standard credit card processing fees or other additional fees) to your debit account.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					In the event that you do not have an ACH-enabled bank account linked to your Account, you may request a physical check. Check requests may be subject to a processing fee and an identity verification process. It is your obligation to request a check or otherwise link an ACH-enabled bank account to your Account in order to receive your funds.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					Funds for any given transaction will not be deposited until the transaction is deemed complete. Transactions will be deemed complete when we have received or sent the funds and when we or the designated financial institutions have accepted the transaction or funds.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
						<span><b>c. Standard Schedule of Payouts</b></span>
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					Once you validate your US bank account, and have ten dollars or more in your Account, SalonHome will automatically initiate a payout to your bank account at the end of every business day when you have more than ten dollars in your account. Payouts to your bank account for payments received before 4pm Pacific Time will usually fund the next business day.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
						<span><b>d. Availability of Funds</b></span>
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					Should SalonHome need to conduct an investigation or resolve any pending dispute related to your Account, we may defer payout or restrict access to your funds for the entire time it takes for us to do so. We also may defer payout or restrict access to your funds as necessary to comply with applicable law or court order, or if otherwise requested by law enforcement or governmental entity.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
						<span><b>7.2 TAXES</b></span>
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					You are responsible for determining any and all taxes assessed, incurred, or required to be collected, paid, or withheld for any reason in connection your use of our software and services ("Taxes"). You also are solely responsible for collecting, withholding, reporting, and remitting correct Taxes to the appropriate tax authority. We are not obligated to, nor will we determine whether Taxes apply, or calculate, collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax authority arising from any transaction. SalonHome specifically disclaims any liability for Taxes.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					If in a given calendar year you receive through the Services (i) more than $15,000 in gross amount of payments, and (ii) more than 150 payments, SalonHome reserves the right to prohibit you from processing any additional payments through the Services and to defer delivery of earned payouts until you have provided (and SalonHome has confirmed receipt of) your accurate User Tax Information (defined below). If in a given calendar year your payments through the Services meet the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) thresholds for required reporting, SalonHome will report your User Tax Information annually to the IRS, as required by law. If SalonHome receives a notification from the IRS at any time that your User Tax Information is incomplete or inaccurate, SalonHome will notify you immediately that you need to provide a completed W-9 form and reserves the right to (i) prohibit you from processing any additional payments through the Services and (ii) defer delivery of any earned payouts, until you have provided and SalonHome has confirmed receipt of updated accurate User Tax Information. If SalonHome does not receive such updated accurate User Tax Information within sixty (60) days of your receipt of SalonHome’s request for updated User Tax Information, SalonHome will deduct any applicable fees owed to SalonHome and will refund all undelivered earned payouts back to the applicable Client. SalonHome disclaims any and all liability related to such refunded payouts. “User Tax Information” means any information required to be provided to the IRS, which includes but is not limited to the following: your name, address, Tax Identification Number (such as a Social Security Number (SSN), or Employer Identification Number (EIN)), the total dollar amount of the payments you receive in a calendar year, and the total dollar amount of the payments you receive for each month in a calendar year. Whether you meet the IRS thresholds for required reporting in a given calendar year will be determined by looking at the Tax Identification Number associated with your Account.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
						<span><b>7.3 CUSTOMER CARE</b></span>
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					Each Professional, as a separate entity from SalonHome, is solely responsible for all customer service issues relating to such Professional's goods or services, including without limitation, any Styling Services, pricing, order fulfillment, order or appointment cancellation, returns, refunds and adjustments, rebates, functionality and warranty, and feedback concerning experiences with such Professional, any personnel, their policies or processes. In performing customer service, Professionals must present themselves as a separate entity from SalonHome. As between Professionals and SalonHome, SalonHome is solely responsible for customer service issues relating to any Account, payment, Card processing, debiting or crediting.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
						<span><b>7.4 REFUNDS AND RETURNS</b></span>
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					By accepting payment Card transactions with SalonHome, you agree to process returns of, and provide refunds and adjustments for, your goods or services through your Account in accordance with these Terms of Service and Network Rules. Network Rules require that you will (a) maintain a fair return, cancellation or adjustment policy; (b) disclose your return or cancellation policy to Clients at the time of purchase, (c) not give cash refunds to a Client in connection with a Card sale, unless required by law, and (d) not accept cash or any other item of value for preparing a Card sale refund. The amount of the refund/adjustment must include any associated taxes required to be refunded and cannot exceed the amount shown as the total on the original sales data except by the exact amount required to reimburse the Client for postage that the Client paid to return merchandise. If you accept returns and are making an uneven exchange of merchandise (e.g., the sales price is not the same), you must issue a credit for the total amount of the merchandise being returned and complete a new sale for any new merchandise. Please be aware, if your refund policy prohibits returns or is unsatisfactory to the Client, you may still receive a Chargeback relating to such sales.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					You can process a refund through your Account up to sixty (60) days from the day you accepted the payment. If your available SalonHome balance is insufficient to cover the refund, SalonHome will request your authorization to withdraw up to the requested refund amount from your bank account or debit card. SalonHome will then withdraw the amount you were paid (the sale amount minus the initial transaction fee) from your bank account or debit card, and credit it back into your Client's Card. The fees are also refunded by SalonHome, so the full purchase amount is always returned to your Client. SalonHome has no obligation to accept any returns of any of your goods or services on your behalf.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
						<span><b>7.5 LIABILITY FOR CHARGEBACKS AND FRAUDULENT ACTIONS</b></span>
					</p>

					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					SalonHome is not liable for any losses relating to Chargebacks, fraudulent charges, or other actions by any User that are deceptive, fraudulent or otherwise invalid as determined in SalonHome's sole discretion ("Fraudulent Actions"). By using the Services, you hereby release SalonHome from any liability arising from Fraudulent Actions. You will also use best efforts to promptly notify SalonHome of any Fraudulent Actions which may affect the Services. SalonHome reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the account of any User that engages in, or enables any other User to engage in, Fraudulent Actions.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
						<span><b>7.6 SALONHOME COLLECTION RIGHTS FOR CHARGEBACKS</b></span>
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					For any transaction that results in a Chargeback, we may withhold the Chargeback amount in a Reserve. We may debit the amount of any Chargeback and any associated fees, fines, or penalties listed in the Fee Schedule or assessed by the Association or our processor from your Account (including without limitation any Reserve), any proceeds due to you, your bank account or debit card, or other payment instrument registered with us. If you have pending Chargebacks, we may delay payouts from your Account. Further, if we reasonably believe that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you under these Terms of Service until such time that: (a) a Chargeback is assessed due to a Client's complaint, in which case we will retain the funds; (b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which the Client may dispute that the transaction has expired; or (c) we determine that a Chargeback on the transaction will not occur. If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for which you are liable, you will pay us the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand. You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including without limitation attorneys' fees and other legal expenses, incurred by or on behalf of us in connection with the collection of all Account deficit balances unpaid by you.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
						<span><b>7.7 EXCESSIVE CHARGEBACKS</b></span>
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					If we determine that you are incurring an excessive amount of Chargebacks, we may establish controls or conditions governing your Account, including without limitation, by (a) establishing new processing fees, (b) creating a Reserve in an amount reasonably determined by us to cover anticipated Chargebacks and related fees, (c) delaying payouts, and (d) terminating or suspending the Services.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
						<span><b>7.8 CONTESTING CHARGEBACKS</b></span>
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					You agree to assist us when requested, at your expense, to investigate any of your transactions processed through the Services. To that end, you permit us to share information about a Chargeback with the Client, the Client's financial institution, and your financial institution in order to investigate and/or mediate a Chargeback. We will request necessary information from you to contest the Chargeback. If the Chargeback is contested successfully, we will release the reserved funds to your Account. If a Chargeback dispute is not resolved in your favor by the Network or issuing bank or you choose not to contest the Chargeback, we may recover the Chargeback amount and any associated fees as described in these Terms of Service. You acknowledge that your failure to assist us in a timely manner when investigating a transaction, including providing necessary documentation within five (5) days of our request, may result in an irreversible Chargeback. We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating and/or investigating Chargeback disputes.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
						<span><b>8. SALONHOME SET-OFF RIGHTS.</b></span>
					</p>

					</p>	
					<p class="mb30">
					To the extent permitted by law, we may set off against the balances for any obligation you owe us under these Terms of Service, including without limitation any Chargebacks. All fees are charged at the time we process a transaction and are deducted first from the transferred or collected funds and thereafter from the balance in your Account. If you owe us an amount that exceeds your balance, we may charge or debit a payment instrument registered in your Account or any connected Account (as well as set off against any balance in any connected Account). Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on demand will be a breach of these Terms of Service. You will be liable for our costs associated with collection in addition to the amount owed, including without limitation attorneys' fees and expenses, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
						<span><b>8.1 INACTIVE ACCOUNTS</b></span>
					</p>
					<p class="mb30">
					If there is no activity in your Account (including access or payment transactions) for at least two years, consecutively, and you have a balance, we will notify you by sending an email to the email address associated with your Account and give you the option of keeping your Account open and maintaining the balance, withdrawing the balance, or requesting a check.

SalonHome will only correct transactions that you process incorrectly if and when you notify us of such an error. Your failure to notify us of a processing error within thirty days of when it first appears on your electronic transaction history will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.
